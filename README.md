# Purchase Order Display Project

This project parses a JSON file containing purchase orders and displays them in a list. Clicking on a purchase order displays detailed information in a Bootstrap modal.

## Goals

1. The first goal of this project is to parse the orders and display them as links in a list.
2. Clicking each order should display some additional information related to the order.
3. For the `PurchaseOrderDetails` field, create a table with rows equal to the PurchaseOrderDetails array length, filled with this information.


## Relation to CV Project

During my first internship, I worked on developing an e-commerce website using React and Bootstrap. The current project utilizes similar technologies and techniques, particularly in the use of React for creating interactive interfaces and Bootstrap for responsive design. Both projects involve creating modals for displaying detailed information and implementing list views of data, showcasing a consistent application of front-end development skills across different business contexts.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Bootstrap
